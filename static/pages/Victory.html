            <p class="description" style="display: none;"> A tool that uses friction to start a fire. They often come in one of two types: safety matches, which can only light against a specially-prepared surface, and strike-anywhere matches, which can light against any surface that provides enough friction. The waterproof variety guarantees use in wet environments, though can often be more difficult to light.</p>

            <p class="description" style="display: none;">A reinforced, reusable water bottle. It’s usually fitted with a shoulder strap or fastening clamp for easy access as well as padding for insulation. If made of stainless steel, then it can also be directly heated to boil the water for cleansing. In frigid environments, snow can be collected and heated (even with body heat) as a water source.</p>

            <p class="description" style="display: none;">An instrument used for navigation and orientation. It contains a pointer that displays the direction of magnetic north and bearings from it, as with the other cardinal directions. However, factors other than the Earth’s magnetic field, like magnetic mineral deposits and some electrical engines, can interfere with its function.</p>

It effectively increases the lifespans of otherwise unusable items, provided they are not beyond restoration (will depend on user skill and stitching method used). In certain circumstances, it can also be used to surgically stitch, or suture, wounds.</p>
