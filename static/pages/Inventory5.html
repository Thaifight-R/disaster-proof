        <!-- Mess Kit -->        
        <div class="project" id="project1">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Mess kit</a>
            
            <p class="description" style="display: none;"> A compact and portable collection of silverware and cookware. Many civilian kits are constructed from aluminum or enameled steel, though titanium is not uncommon. It usually contains at least a pan, kettle, plate, cup, and cutlery.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Waterproof matches -->        
        <div class="project" id="project1">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Waterproof matches</a>
            
            <p class="description" style="display: none;"> A tool that uses friction to start a fire. They often come in one of two types: safety matches, which can only light against a specially-prepared surface, and strike-anywhere matches, which can light against any surface that provides enough friction. The waterproof variety guarantees use in wet environments, though can often be more difficult to light.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Swiss army knife -->          
        <div class="project" id="project1">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Swiss army knife</a>
            
            <p class="description" style="display: none;">A pocketknife with added functionality that essentially makes it a multi-tool. There are countless models each with their own added features, though the most common ones include a blade, screwdriver, can opener, and wire cutter. The largest, still-practical model contains 33 different functions.</p>

        <!-- Insulated tent -->        
        <div class="project" id="project1">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Insulated tent</a>
            <p class="description" style="display: none;"> A portable shelter made of insulating fabric. Its main function is to protect from weather conditions, although the security it gives can sometimes boost morale. Since many varieties exist, the decision for the best type generally comes down to how many people can fit within and if it can be easily carried.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Antibiotics -->          
        <div class="project" id="project1">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Antibiotics</a>
            
            <p class="description" style="display: none;">An antimicrobial drug used to treat and prevent bacterial infections. They are used for a wide variety of purposes and sometimes also possess antiprotozoal activity (against parasites). However, they arenâ€™t at all effective for treating viruses or influenza.</p>
