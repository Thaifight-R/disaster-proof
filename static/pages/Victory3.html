			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Insulated tent</a>
            <p class="description" style="display: none;"> A portable shelter made of insulating fabric. Its main function is to protect from weather conditions, although the security it gives can sometimes boost morale. Since many varieties exist, the decision for the best type generally comes down to how many people can fit within and if it can be easily carried.</p>

            <p class="description" style="display: none;">A partial face covering designed to prevent exposure to small airborne particulate matter. The specific types it protects against include dusts from drywall, wood, brick, and fiberglass. It is the cheaper and lighter option compared to the respirator, though it may not provide as much protection.</p>

            <p class="description" style="display: none;">Equipment used for capturing fish: kits typically including line, hooks, traps, and lures. While it can provide a plentiful source of food, its usefulness is limited by geographic location (if there are no nearby bodies of water). Also called a fishing tackle.</p>

            <p class="description" style="display: none;">A type of pyrotechnic that produces bright light or intense heat without explosion. They are primarily used for signaling or illumination. Additionally, they come in various types, including ground-based (handheld), projectile-based (fired like artillery), and parachute-suspended (dropped from aircraft).</p>

			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Parachute cord</a>
            
            <p class="description" style="display: none;">A lightweight nylon rope originally used in suspension lines of parachutes. It is woven in such a way that the core fibers provide the tensile capacity while the wrapped sheath protects the core from tearing. This ‘kernmantle’ construction is designed to optimize strength, durability, and flexibility. Also referred to as paracord.</p>
