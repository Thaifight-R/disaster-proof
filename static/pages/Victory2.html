			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Sleeping bag</a>
            <p class="description" style="display: none;"> A padded bag that serves as a mobile bed. Its insulation keeps the person warm and lightly protected during rest. The addition of a bivouac sack, or ‘bivy’, around the sleeping bag can provide further shelter by defending against wind chill and rain and is sometimes used as an alternative to tents.</p>

			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Aspirin</a>
            
            <p class="description" style="display: none;">A multipurpose drug used to treat a large number of conditions, including fever, pain, and inflammation. While it’s mainly used to alleviate such symptoms, it is also an effective anti-platelet and has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.</p>

			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Canned food</a>
            
            <p class="description" style="display: none;">Sustenance that is preserved in an airtight container. The canning process produces a longer shelf life (time until expiration) for the contents within, often between one and five years. Freeze-dried canned products, like canned dried beans, may last as long as 30 years.</p>

			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Topographic map</a>
            
            <p class="description" style="display: none;">A chart that typically corresponds to a specific geological region. It is different from other maps due to the level of detail it has, often including contour lines to determine elevations. Additionally, it displays both natural and man-made features.</p>

			<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="thumbnail">Swiss army knife</a>
            
            <p class="description" style="display: none;">A pocketknife with added functionality that essentially makes it a multi-tool. There are countless models each with their own added features, though the most common ones include a blade, screwdriver, can opener, and wire cutter. The largest, still-practical model contains 33 different functions.</p>
